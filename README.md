# SceneDocumentor
SceneDocumentor is - as the name indicates - a plugin for documenting your CINEMA 4D scenes.

It allows you to add text information to any object in your scene, and also make it available for people who don't have SceneDocumentor installed.

In addition to that, it can generate a simple expos√© of your scene in HTML format. The style of the document can be styled by editing the template files.
